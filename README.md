# Subscription Service Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer data for a subscription service to understand customer behavior, identify key trends in cancellations and renewals, and uncover insights into 
customer segmentation by subscription type. The goal is to use data-driven insights to improve customer retention, optimize subscription offerings, and drive revenue growth. 

## Objectives
- Understand the distribution of customers by subscription type and identify top revenue-generating customers.
- Track and analyze cancellation trends to identify points of dissatisfaction.
- Analyze subscription activity over time and region, focusing on customer engagement and revenue performance.

## Data Collected
The dataset includes columns such as:
- CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
- Region: Geographic area of the customer.
- SubscriptionType: Type of subscription (Basic, Standard, Premium).
- Revenue: Revenue generated per customer.
- SubscriptionStart and SubscriptionEnd: Start and end dates of each subscription.
- Canceled: Boolean flag indicating whether the subscription was canceled.

### Data Sources
The data used for this work is gotten from my project work.

## Key Metrics
- Total Customers: Total number of customers.
- Customers by Subscription Type: Count distribution of customers across Basic, Standard, and Premium plans.
- Top 5 Customers by Revenue: Revenue generated by the top five highest-value customers.
- Total Revenue: Total income generated from all customers.
- Revenue by Subscription Type: Revenue distribution across Basic, Standard, and Premium plans.
- Average Revenue per Customer: Average revenue contribution per customer.
- Revenue by Region: Revenue contributions from East, South, West, and North regions.
- Total Cancellations: Total number of canceled subscriptions.
- Cancellations by Region: Breakdown of cancellations by region.
- Monthly Cancellations: Monthly trend in subscription cancellations.
- Monthly Active Subscriptions: Number of active subscriptions over time.
- Active Subscriptions by Region: Distribution of active subscriptions by region.
- Average Subscription Duration: Average subscription length across all customers.


## Tools Used
- Excel: For preliminary data analysis and calculations.
- SQL: For querying and extracting insights from the customer and subscription data.
- Power BI: For interactive visualizations and dashboard creation.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For calculating key performance metrics such as churn rate, revenue per customer, and subscription trends.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Data Loading and Inspection (Duplicates information were removed)
- No Missing Variables
- Creation of Calculated columns and measures

## Data Analysis
The following are the Excel formulas, SQL codes, DAX Expressions used during my Analysis
```
EXCEL FORMULA
Average Subscription Duration	= (12) =DATEDIF(@Sheet1!E:E,@Sheet1!F:F, "M")

SQLITE CODES
1. SELECT Region, COUNT(DISTINCT CustomerID) AS TotalCustomers
FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY Region;

2. SELECT TOP 1 SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS NumberOfCustomers
FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY NumberOfCustomers DESC;

3. SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd, canceled
FROM CustomerData
WHERE Canceled = 'TRUE' 
  AND DATEDIFF(Month, 31/01/2022, 31/12/2024) <= 6;

4. SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(Month, 31/01/2022, 31/12/2024)) AS AverageSubscriptionDuration
FROM CustomerData

5. SELECT CustomerID, CustomerName, SubscriptionStart, SubscriptionEnd
FROM CustomerData
WHERE DATEDIFF(month, 31/01/2022, 31/12/2024) > 12;
 
6. SELECT SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS TotalRevenue
FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
 
7. SELECT TOP 3 Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS Cancellations
FROM CustomerData
WHERE Canceled = 'TRUE'
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY Cancellations DESC

8. SELECT CASE WHEN Canceled = 'TRUE' THEN 'Canceled' ELSE 'Active' END AS SubscriptionStatus, COUNT(CustomerID) AS Total_Count
FROM CustomerData
GROUP BY canceled;

DAX MEASURES USED IN POWERBI
Average Subscription Duration = AVERAGE(CustomerData[Subscription Duration (Months)]
)
Total Revenue = SUM(CustomerData[Revenue])
TotalCustomers = DISTINCTCOUNT(CustomerData[CustomerID])
Calculated Columns - Subscription Duration (Months) = DATEDIFF(CustomerData[SubscriptionStart],CustomerData[SubscriptionEnd],MONTH)
```
